# The Freckle API Toolbox

We're really excited about the next version of the Freckle API ([https://developer.letsfreckle.com/v2]([https://developer.letsfreckle.com/v2])), and we want it to make it as easy as possible to get started using it. That's why we're building a "toolbox" for the new API, which will include samples and other useful tidbits.

The biggest tool is the "Freckle API V2.paw" file. This can be opened by [Paw.app](https://luckymarmot.com/paw), which is a fantastic app for testing APIs and generating boilerplate code for an API request.

Have any questions, or want to be invited to the closed beta for API V2? Shoot an email to cannon@slash7.com!
